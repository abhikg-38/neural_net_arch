# neural_net_arch
This ML projects experiments with various Sequential and Wide and Deep neural network architecture approaches to tackle multiple datasets. Initially simple multi layered perceptrons are used for image classification tasks, after which more complex neural network approaches used for both regression and classification problems. Tensorboard is made thorough use of, variation of attributes across epochs is analyzed and noted.
